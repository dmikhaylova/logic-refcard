# Classical Logic reference card (aka cheat sheet)
The [card](/Logic%20cheat%20sheet.pdf) covers some symbols and formal notation used in classical logic: propositional and predicate.

* Logical symbols
* Connectives (operators) with rules
* How to construct truth table
* Construction of proposition and main connective
* Scope of quantifier and bound variables
* Rules for semantic (tableaux) trees
* Methods to check logical properties using trees (validity, satisfiability, equivalence ..)
* Rules to move quatifiers for prenex normal form

I composed this reference card during and after the Logic course at University of Pisa as I found very challenging to grasp and remember all symbols and rules.
The notation and some definitions comes from the "Logic: The Laws of Truth" by Nicholas J.J. Smith (just great!)
